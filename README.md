<h1>Mafalda</h1>  <h5>In Spanish (Matrix, functions, limits and derivatives)</h5>
     <h2>What is it?</h2>
     <p>It is a desktop software focused on performing mathematical operations</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Arrays</li>
         <p>Indicates a 2-column matrix with "X" number of rows, and this can be scaled, transformed or rotated as needed</p>
         <li>Functions</li>
         <p>After writing a mathematical function, you will be able to graph it and evaluate a specific interval</p>
         <li>Limits</li>
         <p>A mathematical function is required with respect to "X", then the value towards which the variable tends, and the first 3 values that approach from the right and left are shown respectively</p>
         <li>Derivatives</li>
         <p>A function is requested with respect to "X" and the result of its derivative is displayed</p>
     </ul>
